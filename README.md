# `tuts`: time-uncertain time series in R

`tuts` is an R package that enables time-uncertain time series analysis in R using an errors-in-variables approach. A stable version is not yet on CRAN but the GitHub version can be installed with:

```
library(devtools) # Install if not available
install_github('peterfranke/tuts')
library(tuts)
```

You then might like to look at the examples in `help(tubfs)` for time uncertain Bayesian frequency selection, or `help(tuar1)` for time uncertain Bayesian autoregressive modelling (currently only order 1), amongst others. A more complete vignette will be available shortly.
